To use this API:

Clone the project to your local machine and run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`, to start the node server.

Once you have started the server, you can use the following to access the API

POST http://localhost:3000/nearest-pharmacy 
JSON body example:
```
{
    "latitude": 39,
    "longitude": -95
}
```

I use Postman (https://www.postman.com/postman/) to make most API requests, but there are a variety of ways that you can make requests.
